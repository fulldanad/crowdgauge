crowdgauge
===========
[CrowdGauge](http://crowdgauge.org) is framework for creating educational online games that first ask people to rank a set of priorities and then explains how various mechanisms and actions would impact those priorities.

## Background
The game was originally developed by Sasaki Associates as part of the Greater Des Moines [Tomorrow Plan](http://www.thetomorrowplan.com/). This is a regional planning initiative, however the same approach can be applied to any situation where its meaningful to evaluate a series of actions or mechanisms in terms of people's priorities.

## All JavaScript
Jquery on the front-end, Node.js server and CouchDB as the database. You can obviously host this anywhere Node.js is supported, however we recommend [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/) if you want to get up and running quickly as our installation instructions will guide you through this process.

## Status
We're actively developing this product for a mid-November beta launch.
