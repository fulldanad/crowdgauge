===========
[CrowdGauge](http://crowdgauge.org) is an open-source framework for creating educational online games. It first asks users to rank a set of priorities, then demonstrates how a series of actions and policies might impact those priorities. The third part of the sequence gives users a limited number of coins, asking them to put that money towards the actions they support most.

## Background
Sasaki Associates first developed the platform in partnership with the Des Moines Area MPO (DMAMPO) as part of [The Tomorrow Plan](http://www.thetomorrowplan.com/), a regional plan for sustainable development in the Central Iowa region. The original game, named DesignMyDSM, can be found here: http://interactive.thetomorrowplan.com/

## All JavaScript
Jquery on the front-end, Node.js server and CouchDB as the database. You can obviously host this anywhere Node.js is supported, however we recommend [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/) if you want to get up and running quickly as our [installation instructions](https://github.com/placematters-decision-lab/crowdgauge/wiki/Installation-Instructions-on-NodeJitsu) will guide you through this process.

## Status
CrowdGauge is not 100% complete, but it is ready for alpha testing. Please see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/placematters-decision-lab/crowdgauge/wiki/Installation-Instructions-on-NodeJitsu) for more information.
