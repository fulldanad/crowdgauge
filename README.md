===========
[CrowdGauge](http://crowdgauge.org) is framework for creating educational online games that first ask people to rank a set of priorities and then explain how various mechanisms and actions would impact those priorities.

## Background
The game was originally developed by Sasaki Associates as part of the Greater Des Moines [Tomorrow Plan](http://www.thetomorrowplan.com/). This is a regional planning initiative, however the same approach can be applied to any situation where its meaningful to demonstrate how a series of actions or mechanisms relate to people's priorities.

The original game can be found here: http://interactive.thetomorrowplan.com/

## All JavaScript
Jquery on the front-end, Node.js server and CouchDB as the database. You can obviously host this anywhere Node.js is supported, however we recommend [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/) if you want to get up and running quickly as our installation instructions will guide you through this process.

## Status
CrowdGauge is not 100% complete, but it is now ready for alpha testing. Please see the installation instructions.
