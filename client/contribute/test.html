    <h3>Notes on Actions</h3>

    <div id="action">
        <p>Each general mechanism can have a number of specific actions. For example a mechanism 'Build more roads'
            could have these actions assigned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build 9 miles of two-lane road</li>
            <li>Build 9 miles of 4-lane highway with 3 interchanges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When playing the game, users are given a fixed number of coins and asked to choose how they would allocate
            them. Each action is assigned a certain number of coins to indicate relative expense. Some actions may cost
            nothing.</p>

        <p>Each column represents a particular number of coins. Add new action columns to represent a different number
            of coins.</p>

        <p>In addition to cost, each action is given a multiplier to indicate how effective it is in achieving the goals
            of the mechanism. This multiplier is applied to the scores for each priority (both positive and
            negative).</p>
